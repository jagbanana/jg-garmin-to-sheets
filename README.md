# üöÄ GarminGo: Make data-driven decisions about your health, fitness, and longevity! üìÑüìà

Pull your daily health metrics from Garmin Connect and save them directly to a user-friendly CSV file or Google Sheets.

I created this utility to feed my data into AI (e.g. LLMs like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini) so that I could gain insights for improving my health and longevity. 

Even if you aren't technical, getting your data as a CSV is pretty simple! 

Once you have the files here, Python installed, and the project set up (step-by-step instructions below), you can run it by typing *garmingo*!

While it's simple for non-technical users, it also supports power users, allowing you to schedule and run everything via command line arguments.

**üîí Security & Privacy First:**

*   **Open Source:** GarminGo's code is simple and viewable by anyone.
*   **Local Credentials:** Your Garmin login details are stored securely on *your* computer in the `.env` file (which you create).
*   **Google Integration (Optional):** If using Google Sheets, the app securely links your Google account via your browser the first time you run it for Sheets output.

‚ú® Pro tip!

If feeding your data to an LLM (like Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini), ensure you are on a paid plan and that you check the privacy settings. Paid Claude accounts are "private by default" making Claude an excellent option. 

Power users can also consider running local LLMs.

## üöÄ Quick Start: Get Your Data as a CSV File

This is the easiest way to get started and export your Garmin data.

**1. üêç Install Python:**
   *   Make sure you have Python 3.9 or newer installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   *   During install, ensure you check "Add Python to PATH."

**2. üìÑ Get the Code:**
   *   Go to the GarminGo GitHub repository page (you are probably already there).
   *   Click the green "Code" button (at the top right of the page) and select **"Download ZIP"**.
   *   Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your computer (e.g., `C:\GarminGo` or `/Users/YourName/GarminGo`).
   *   *(Advanced users can clone the repository using `git clone ...` if preferred).*

**3. ‚ú® Install the Project and Dependencies:**
   *   **Open PowerShell or Command Prompt (CMD) in the Project Folder:**
       1.  Open File Explorer and navigate to the folder where you extracted the downloaded ZIP file (e.g., `jg-garmin-to-sheets-main`).
       2.  Click in the address bar at the top of File Explorer.
       3.  Type `powershell` and press Enter. (Alternatively, type `cmd` and press Enter).
       *   This opens a terminal window directly in your project folder. You should see the folder path in the prompt (e.g., `PS C:\path\to\jg-garmin-to-sheets-main>`).
   *   *(Alternatively, open PowerShell/CMD from the Start Menu and use the `cd` command to navigate: `cd path\to\your\jg-garmin-to-sheets-main`)*
   *   In the PowerShell or CMD window you just opened, run the following command. This will install GarminGo and all its required libraries (defined in `pyproject.toml`), making the `garmingo` command available in your terminal:
        ```powershell
        pip install .
        ```
   *   *(For developers or if you want an "editable" install, which allows your code changes to be reflected immediately without reinstalling, you can use `pip install -e .`)*

**4. ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Your Garmin Login:**
   *   In the project folder, find the file named `.env.example`.
   *   **Make a copy** of this file and **rename the copy** to just `.env`.
   *   Open the `.env` file with a text editor (like Notepad or VS Code).
   *   Find the lines starting with `USER1_` and fill in *only* your Garmin Connect email and password:
     	 ```dotenv
      	# User Profile 1
      	USER1_GARMIN_EMAIL=your_garmin_email@example.com # <-- Put your email here
      	USER1_GARMIN_PASSWORD=your_garmin_password     # <-- Put your password here
      	USER1_SHEET_ID= # <-- Leave this blank for CSV output
      	```

   *   Save the `.env` file. (You can add more `USER<N>_` profiles later if needed).

**5. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the App & Get CSV:**
   *   Ensure you are in the project's root directory in your terminal (PowerShell, CMD, bash, etc.). If the Python scripts directory was added to your system's PATH during Python installation, you might be able to run `garmingo` from any directory.
   *   Run the application using the `garmingo` command:
        ```powershell
        garmingo
        ```
   *   **Alternative:** You can also run the script directly using Python (this is useful if you chose not to install the package via `pip install .` or for troubleshooting):
        ```powershell
        python -m src.main
        ```
   *   The interactive menu will appear:
       1.  **Choose Output:** Select `1` for `CSV`.
       2.  **Select Profile:** Choose the user profile you configured (e.g., `USER1`).
       3.  **Enter Dates:** Input the start and end dates using the `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g., `2024-01-01`).
   *   The app will fetch your data.

**6. üìÅ Get Your Data!**
   *   Success! Your data is saved as a CSV file named `garmingo_<profile_name>.csv` (e.g., `garmingo_USER1.csv`) inside the `output` folder within the project directory.
   *   This `output` folder should automatically open in your file explorer, showing you the file.

**7. Optional: Prep Your AI!**

   *   As shown in the screenshots above, once you have your data, you can connect it to the AI of your choice.
   *   Describe in full detail what YOU want help with. 
   *   Give the LLM a clear role.
   *   Add as much documentation as you are comfortable with. This can be GarminGo data, a log of your protocol changes, doctor notes, blood work, and more.

**Sample Instructions:**

> **Project Goal**
> 
> The goal of this project is to optimize my health, happiness, and longevity. In order to do that, I need to measure various aspects of my life and make data-driven adjustments in my routine over time.
> 
> I want you to act as my advisor, assisting in providing research-based recommendations and facts that will aid in my decision-making processes. You will effectively be my "Longevity Advisor" layering in expertise from the nutrition, fitness, and medical fields. I understand I need to make any final decisions myself and with a medical professional, but you can still provide me with information to help guide my decision making and sharpen the questions I ask.
> 
> In the Knowledge, you will find these documents:
> (list documents with a description)
> 
> I want you to act as my partner and consultant in this journey, helping me brainstorm and objectively look at progress and areas of opportunity.
> 
> Look for changes and ideas that will make the most impact with the least effort and expense. That said, if there are high-value, high-probability changes I can make that will require effort or cost, it is okay to recommend them too. Just ensure changes are prioritized. The 80/20 rule and Pareto chart concepts will likely apply here.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Options & Google Sheets Integration

This section is for users who want to output data directly to Google Sheets or use Python virtual environments.

**Optional: Use a Python Virtual Environment**

For cleaner dependency management, you might want to create and activate a virtual environment *before* installing the project (as described in Quick Start Step 3).

1.  Navigate to the project directory.
2.  Create a virtual environment (e.g., named `venv`):
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3.  Activate the virtual environment:
    *   Windows (PowerShell): `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
4.  Then, install the project within the activated environment:
    ```powershell
    pip install .
    ```
    *(Or `pip install -e .` for an editable install).*
5.  Remember to activate this virtual environment (`venv`) each time you want to run the app using the `garmingo` command or `python -m src.main`.

### Optional: Running as a Scheduled Task

For users who wish to run GarminGo non-interactively (e.g., as a scheduled task), command-line arguments can be used. This allows you to specify the start date, end date, user profile, and output type directly.

After installing the project (see Step 3 in Quick Start), you can use the `garmingo` command:
```powershell
garmingo cli-sync --start-date YYYY-MM-DD --end-date YYYY-MM-DD --profile YOUR_PROFILE_NAME --output-type <csv_or_sheets>
```
Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with the desired dates, `YOUR_PROFILE_NAME` with your configured profile name (e.g., `USER1`), and `<csv_or_sheets>` with either `csv` or `sheets`.

**Alternative:** If you haven't installed the project via `pip install .` or prefer to run it directly with Python:
```powershell
python -m src.main cli-sync --start-date YYYY-MM-DD --end-date YYYY-MM-DD --profile YOUR_PROFILE_NAME --output-type <csv_or_sheets>
```
Ensure you are in the project's root directory when using `python -m src.main`.

### üîë Google API Setup (for Google Sheets Output)

To send data to Google Sheets, you need to set up Google API credentials.

1.  **Google Cloud Console:**
    *   Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    *   Create a new project or select an existing one.
    *   Enable the **Google Sheets API** for your project.
2.  **Create OAuth Credentials:**
    *   Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
    *   Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" > "OAuth client ID".
    *   Select "Desktop app" as the application type. Give it a name (e.g., "GarminGo Client").
    *   Click "Create". You'll see a Client ID and Client Secret (you don't need to copy these now).
    *   Click **"DOWNLOAD JSON"** on the right side of the newly created credential.
3.  **Save Credentials File:**
    *   Create a folder named `credentials` inside your main GarminGo project folder.
    *   Move the downloaded JSON file into this `credentials` folder.
    *   **Rename** the downloaded file to `client_secret.json`.
4.  **Configure `.env` for Google:**
    *   Open your `.env` file.
    *   Ensure the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_PATH` points to your file:
     ```dotenv
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_PATH=credentials/client_secret.json
     ```
    *   The `GOOGLE_TOKEN_PATH` is where the app will store your authorization token once you grant access. The default is usually fine:
     ```dotenv
     GOOGLE_TOKEN_PATH=credentials/token.pickle
     ```
    *   For *each user profile* you want to sync to Sheets, you **must** provide a `USER<N>_SHEET_ID`:
        *   Create a Google Sheet for the data.
        *   The Sheet ID is in the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[THIS-IS-THE-SHEET-ID]/edit`
        *   Copy this ID into the corresponding `USER<N>_SHEET_ID` field in your `.env` file:
          ```dotenv
          USER1_GARMIN_EMAIL=user1@example.com
          USER1_GARMIN_PASSWORD=password1
          USER1_SHEET_ID=the_actual_sheet_id_from_google # <-- Add Sheet ID here
          ```
    *   Save the `.env` file.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running for Google Sheets Output:

1.  Make sure your `.env` file is configured with the Sheet ID(s) and Google credential paths.
2.  Activate your virtual environment if you are using one.
3.  Run the app from the project directory using the `garmingo` command (after installing the project as per Quick Start Step 3):
    ```powershell
    garmingo
    ```
4.  **Alternative:** You can also run the script directly using Python:
    ```powershell
    python -m src.main
    ```
5.  Follow the interactive menu:
    1.  **Choose Output:** Select `2` for `Google Sheets`.
    2.  **Select Profile:** Choose the user profile (ensure it has a `SHEET_ID` in `.env`).
    3.  **Enter Dates:** Input start and end dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
6.  **‚ùóFirst Run Only:** Your web browser will open, asking you to log in to your Google account and grant permission for the app to access your Google Sheets. Allow access. A `token.pickle` file will be created in your `credentials` folder.
7.  The app will then fetch the data and write it to the specified Google Sheet.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

*   **`garmingo` Command Not Found After Installation:**
    *   If you run `garmingo` in your terminal after installing with `pip install .` (as described in the Quick Start section) and receive an error like "'garmingo' is not recognized as an internal or external command..." (Windows) or "command not found: garmingo" (macOS/Linux), it's likely because the directory where Python installed the script is not included in your system's PATH environment variable.
    *   The `pip install .` command output might show a warning message if the scripts directory is not on PATH, often including the exact path. For example, on Windows, this directory could be `C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Python\PythonXX\Scripts` (where `YourUserName` is your username and `PythonXX` is your Python version like `Python311`).
    *   **To add this directory to your PATH on Windows:**
        1.  In the Windows search bar, type "environment variables" and select "Edit the system environment variables".
        2.  In the System Properties window, click the "Environment Variables..." button.
        3.  Under "User variables for YourUserName" (or "System variables" if you want it available for all users), find and select the `Path` variable, then click "Edit...". (If it doesn't exist, click "New..." to create it).
        4.  Click "New" and add the full path to the Python scripts directory (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Python\PythonXX\Scripts`).
        5.  Click "OK" on all dialogs to save.
        6.  **Important:** You must close and reopen any terminal windows (CMD, PowerShell) for the changes to take effect. Sometimes, a system restart might be needed.
    *   For **macOS/Linux** users, the scripts directory is often `~/.local/bin`. You would add this to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile`) by adding a line like `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`, and then sourcing the file (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc`) or opening a new terminal.
*   **Garmin Login Issues:** Double-check `USER<N>_GARMIN_EMAIL` and `USER<N>_GARMIN_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file.
*   **Google Sheets Access Denied / Errors:**
    *   Ensure the Google Sheets API is enabled in your Google Cloud project.
    *   Verify the `USER<N>_SHEET_ID` in `.env` is correct and that the Google account you authorized has edit access to that specific Sheet.
    *   Try deleting the `credentials/token.pickle` file and running the app again (choose Sheets output). This forces re-authentication via your browser.
*   **`FileNotFoundError` for `.env` or `client_secret.json`:** Make sure you are running the `python -m src.main` command from the *main project directory* (the one containing `src`, `requirements.txt`, etc.) and that the files exist in the correct locations (`.env` in the root, `client_secret.json` inside the `credentials` folder).
*   **Module Not Found Errors:** Ensure you have installed dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and activated your virtual environment if you created one.

---

## üîí Security Notes

*   **Never share or commit your `.env` file** to Git or any public place, as it contains your passwords.
*   The `.gitignore` file is already set up to prevent accidental commits of `.env` and the `credentials` folder.
*   Keep your Google `client_secret.json` file secure.
